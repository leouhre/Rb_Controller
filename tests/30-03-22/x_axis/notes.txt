We have decided on a heater placement strategy. The decision on wrapping the heaters verticcally around the cell was based on the fact that this placement strategy makes Dayang's
"tuning by resistance" possible. Furthermore, we have decided to place the gap on the top of the cell, since the test:
"C:\Users\leouh\Documents\Rb_Controller\tests\30-03-22\17V_circumference_gap_on_bottom" 
showed that placing the gap on the bottom just moved the coldest spot down there and therefore the influence on the uniformity is not - if even - significant. We prioritize 
to optimize uniformity along the x-axis, and placing the gap on the top is possible for all of the heaters, which is not the case for the gap on the bottom because of the "tip"
